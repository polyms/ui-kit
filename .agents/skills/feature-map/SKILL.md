# Feature map

Behavior index for the public docs site. Agents open one area file. Humans use the index as the regression checklist.

## Feature map

Index: [references/features/README.md](references/features/README.md).

- No area link in the index (a markdown link to a sibling `*.md`) → the map is not ready. Stop.
  Do not invent areas by reading the app.
- One surface → read the index, open the one matching file, stop. Do not open a second area file.
- A change that crosses the docs-navigation and component-guides areas → also open `journeys.md` when
  the index lists it.
- Broad regression → walk the index top to bottom. The journeys file is last.
- An unreachable path → name it, name the blocker (account, OS, entitlement, or native driver),
  and cover the closest real path that remains.

Harness: see `Harness` in `docs/agents/feature-map.md`. `none` means drive by selector and visible
action. Do not invent a driver.

## Proof bar

Exercise the user-visible path. Record the action and the stable end state. A compile, a unit
test, or a mock that skips the surface under test is not proof.

## Entry contract

Every file under `references/features/` uses these H2s, in order:

1. `Sub-features`
2. `How to get to it (user POV)`
3. `Driving it`
4. `Gotchas`
