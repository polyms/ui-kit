# Language

The language skills write into persistent repo docs.

## Scope

**Applies to:** `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/adr/`, PRDs, `docs/design/*.md`, `docs/agents/*.md`, and other files that outlive the conversation.

**Does not apply to:** chat replies — those match whichever language the user is typing in for that session. Code, identifiers, file paths, commit messages, and technical vocabulary (seam, ADR, PRD, sortOrder, …) stay in English regardless of this setting.

## Language

**Vietnamese** — prose, headings, and comments in written docs. Technical terms and code stay in English.

## Consumers

Skills that write persistent docs read this file and write in the confirmed language:

- `domain-modeling` — `CONTEXT.md`, glossary entries
- `pm`, `to-prd` — PRDs, user stories, acceptance criteria
- `design` — `docs/design/<feature>.md`
- `arch` — ADRs in `docs/adr/`
- `to-issues` — issue bodies on the tracker

## Rules

- One language per repo — do not mix within a single artifact
- Headings, prose, and comments in Vietnamese; code and identifiers in English
- If a user writes in a different language than this file specifies, still write the artifact in Vietnamese — flag the mismatch rather than silently switching
